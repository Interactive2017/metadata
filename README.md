## Metadata for interactions

Creating and working with interactive figures affects two databases of `o2r/muncher`:

- `compendia`, where the configuration of a figure and all results are stored (URL of openCPU endpoints) (see [compendia.json](https://github.com/Interactive2017/metadata/blob/master/compendia.json))
